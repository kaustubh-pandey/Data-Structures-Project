# Data-Structures-Project
An application of Binary Search Tree and Trie Datastructures - Telecom Billing System

We are implementing the Telecom Billing System which facilitates you to add telephone numbers, delete them and Serach them(either by name or by phone no.)

For our project we chose Binary Search Tree(BST) as our data structure as the main focus of our project

was on searching records and BST has average time complexity O(log n) and worst case O(n) for search, delete

and insert operations. For searching records we have also used Trie data structure to search by name.

Please read Readme.txt for detailed information about functions.

To run this project:

1. Compile using gcc p30-main().c

2. ./a.out would run the program.

Note- This program requires gcc. The project appears best on Linux systems. For running in Windows try installing Cygwin.
