# Data-Structures-Project
An application of Binary Search Tree and Trie Data Structures - Telecom Billing System

An implementation of the Telecom Billing System which facilitates you to add telephone numbers, delete them and Serach them(either by name or by phone no.)

* For our project we chose Binary Search Tree(BST) as our data structure to search records by Phone Number as the main focus of our project was on searching records.BST has average time complexity O(log n) and worst case O(n) for search, delete
and insert operations. 

* For searching records by Name of Person we have used Trie(Prefix Tree) data structure.

Please read Readme.txt for detailed information about functions.
